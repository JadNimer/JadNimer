# My Interests

I am interested in a lot of different things. My favorite thing is video games. I enjoy trying different game genres and games with interesting mechanics. My favorite video game of all time is "Detroit Becoming Human".

Even though this game has been out for over 5 years, it remains one of my favorite games. Whenever I return to the game, I still feel like I am playing a new game. 

**Here is a link to buy this game:**
